Similarly, implement the function below which takes two integer inputs (M and N), finds the least common multiple of them.
For example,

if the given numbers are 18 and 27, your code should return 54, which is their least common multiple.
if the given numbers are 17 and 31, your code should return 527, which is their least common multiple.

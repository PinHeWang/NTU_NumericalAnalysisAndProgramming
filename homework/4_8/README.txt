Write a function, which takes a list of five strings as input. The strings are the selected "cards" from the 52-card deck. The function can check if the input list of "cards" matches the poker hand "Full House" (contains three matching cards of one rank and two matching cards of another rank). For example, if the input matches a pattern similar to

['CLUB-7', 'DIAMOND-7', 'SPADE-7','DIAMOND-Q', 'CLUB-Q']
you should return True. Otherwise your function should return False.

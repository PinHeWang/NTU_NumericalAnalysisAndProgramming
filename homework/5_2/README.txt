Follow up the previous implementation of the 3-dimensional vector class. Now please overwrite another base method __str__, which allows user to convert the object to a string, and hence the object can be printed directly by the template code. You should have the following two lines to be printed (please use '%g' to format the float point numbers):

converting v1 to string: (3,4,5)
converting v2 to string: (5.2,7.4,-2.5)
(You may want to copy your constructor prepared for the previous assignment to here as well.)

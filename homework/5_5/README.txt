Based on the previous implementation of the 3-dimensional vector class. Please implement the function inner() which should return the result of inner product. Hence the later part of the template code can be executed accordingly, and have the following lines to be printed:

inner(v1,v2) = 32.7000
inner(v1,v3) = 23.1000
inner(v2,v3) = 42.0000

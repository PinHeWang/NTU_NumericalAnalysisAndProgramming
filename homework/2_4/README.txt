Similarly, implement the function below which takes a single integer input, finds out all of the prime factors, and returns the sum of them. 
For example,

if the input is 4, which has 2 as its only prime factor. Your code should just return 2.
if the input is 10, which has 2 and 5 as its prime factors. Your code should return 2+5, which is 7.

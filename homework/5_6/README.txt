Based on the previous implementation of the 3-dimensional vector class. Similar to the previous assignment, please implement the function outer() which should return the outer product vector. Hence the later part of the template code can be executed accordingly, and have the following lines to be printed:

outer(v1,v2) = (-47,33.5,1.4)
outer(v1,v3) = (-21,10.5,4.2)
outer(v2,v3) = (10.5,-5.25,6.3)

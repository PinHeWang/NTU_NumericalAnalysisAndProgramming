Character/letter rotation: construct a function which takes an input string with only letters, automatically apply the following mapping to the string, and return the output:

a --> b 
b --> c
c --> d
...
y --> z
z --> a
As an example, if the input is "banana", you should return "cbobob". Note the mapping should apply to both upper and lower cases.

Construct a function which takes an input integer n, and output a two-dimensional nxn NumPy array with the following patttern:

array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5, ..., n   ],
       [ 2,  3,  4,  5,  6, ..., n+1 ],
       [ 3,  4,  5,  6,  7, ..., n+2 ],
       [ 4,  5,  6,  7,  8, ..., n+3 ],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9, ..., n+4 ],
       [ ...              , ..., ... ],
       [ n,n+1,n+2,n+3,n+4, ..., 2n-1]])

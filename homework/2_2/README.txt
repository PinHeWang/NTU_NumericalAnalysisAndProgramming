Following up the previous quiz, monkeys are not only loving to have more food in the morning (A), rather than in the afternoon (B) or evening (C), but also happy if any one of the meals is much larger than the other two meals, ie. The monkeys will be happy if A is larger than or equal to B, and B is larger than or equal to C; they will be also happy if any meal is larger than the sum of the other two meals. Otherwise they will be angry.

Implement the given function as following:
return True if the monkeys are happy; return False if the monkeys are angry.

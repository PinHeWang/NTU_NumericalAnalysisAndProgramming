Define a 3-dimensional vector class to handle a vector in cartesian coordinate (x,y,z). Please implement the constructor and allow the class to record the x-y-z coordinate, and can be used in the later part of the template code. That is --- you should allow the template code to print out something like:

attributes of v1: 3.0 4.0 5.0
attributes of v2: 5.2 7.4 -2.5

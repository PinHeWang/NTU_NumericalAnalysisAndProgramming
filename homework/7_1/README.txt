Construct a function which takes an input integer n, and output a two-dimensional 10x10 NumPy array with the following patttern:

array([[0, n, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, n, 0],
       [n, 0, n, 0, 0, 0, 0, n, 0, n],
       [0, n, 0, n, 0, 0, n, 0, n, 0],
       [0, 0, n, 0, n, n, 0, n, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, n, n, n, n, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, n, n, n, n, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, n, 0, n, n, 0, n, 0, 0],
       [0, n, 0, n, 0, 0, n, 0, n, 0],
       [n, 0, n, 0, 0, 0, 0, n, 0, n],
       [0, n, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, n, 0]])
where 'n' above shoud be replaced with the input integer.

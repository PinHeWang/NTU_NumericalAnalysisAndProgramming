Implement the function below which takes three integer inputs (year, month and day), and calculates how many days has been passed since the reference date September 26, 1905?

if the inputs are year=1905, month=9, day=27, your code should return 1, which is just 1 day after the reference date.
if the inputs are year=2005, month=9, day=26, your code should return 36525, which is exactly 100 years after the reference date.

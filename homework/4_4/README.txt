Construct a function which takes an input string with two single-digit numbers, for example, '12', '06', '99'. Apply such an operation for 4 times and return the output string: take any two nearby digits, calculate the sum, and insert the sum (as a string) into the middle of these two digits.
For example:

'12' <-- input
'132' <-- 1st operation
'14352' <-- 2nd operation
'154738572' <-- 3rd operation
'1659411710311813512792' <-- 4th operation, output

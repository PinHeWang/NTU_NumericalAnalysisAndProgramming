Now with a little bit of general physics --- implement a function which takes 4 arguments: m (in the unit of kg, which is the mass of cannon ball), v0 (in the unit of m/sec, the inital speed of the cannon ball), theta (in radian, which is the inital angle of the cannon), and t (in sec, the time period right after cannon fire). The function supposes to return the coordinate of the projectile motion (x,y) at the given time t. Assuming there is no other forces/interactions except the uniform gravity, with the constant g = 9.8 m/sec2.
